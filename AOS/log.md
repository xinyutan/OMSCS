As I said, because of the forseeable workload, I need to listen to course video now. Here are some links to the notes: [L02](https://dynalist.io/d/JMXCbGIvj7qH_Q_YrP8sdvBS)

I was debating whether to take this class next semester, because I fear that I can't do it. But yesterday I watched a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQWiLZ1M6xw), in which the second lesson for him is "lean into the fear". Basically, whenever there's something I fear to do (not meaningless risk or physical danger), then I should opt for doing it. I agree with it. So I will try my best to get through this AOS class for the second semester, just as I planned.
