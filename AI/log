Even though this class has a high difficult rating on omscentral, it is a low effort class for me. Other than that I am familiar with the concept, I think my job may really train me to be a better code than before, at least when writing more complicated code (project 1, specifically) I felt that I am not so much limited by the implementation but more by the algorithm.

To me it is not as challenging as GIOS (except for the project 1), but I do enjoy coding all the homework projects: tri-directinal UCS/A*, minimax/alpha-beta pruning for game playing, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample a Bayes Net, and the recent one, coding a decision tree and random forest from scratch. It really satisfied my long-overdue curiosity to implement these algorithms.
