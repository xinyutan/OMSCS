OMSCS

I officially started the program August 17, 2020. It actually feels pretty normal, maybe because I take MOOCs all the time. This is just a more difficult and systematic MOOC.

2021 Spring

After the meeting with my boss, I think I can't take AOS next semester. I think it over: this project at work, I probably only have this one chance, but I can take AOS anytime. For the next few months, my main focus is to make sure the project at work is a success. But I also want to learn something outside the work: I don't know much about information security, CS-6035: Introduction to Information Security looks to be a good class to fill that knowledge gap, and it looks like a level less difficult than GIOS rather than 2 levels above (AOS), then it is a perfect class. 

I also know that we can take as many classes as we can in this program; 10 classes is just the minimum to fulfill the degree requirement. I planned to take only the most difficult (:)) ones because I worry that they are harder to pick up on my own. Now I think I'll just take all the classes I want to learn: it will just take longer for me to graduate (but anyways I don't really care about the degree).

=========

I will be taking 6210 Advanced Operating Systems. I'm almost done with 6200. It is not a easy ride. The projects are difficult on a conceptual level, mostly because I've never done these kind of programming before. But I like the push. I like the feeling of understanding slowly but steadily. CS6210 is definitely more challenging. I am not sure if I can make it through 4 projects. I am worried, but I think it is good worry and scary.


2020 Fall

Eventually, I took the advice to just take one class in the first semester. I want to lay a solid foundation to my future study in computing systems, hence CS6200 Introduction to Operating System it is.
