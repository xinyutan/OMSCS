OMSCS

I officially started the program August 17, 2020. It actually feels pretty normal, maybe because I take MOOCs all the time. This is just a more difficult and systematic MOOC.

2020 Fall

Eventually, I took the advice to just take one class in the first semester. I want to lay a solid foundation to my future study in computing systems, hence CS6200 Introduction to Operating System it is.
