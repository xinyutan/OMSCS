OMSCS

I officially started the program August 17, 2020. It actually feels pretty normal, maybe because I take MOOCs all the time. This is just a more difficult and systematic MOOC.

2021 Spring

I will be taking 6210 Advanced Operating Systems. I'm almost done with 6200. It is not a easy ride. The projects are difficult on a conceptual level, mostly because I've never done these kind of programming before. But I like the push. I like the feeling of understanding slowly but steadily. CS6210 is definitely more challenging. I am not sure if I can make it through 4 projects. I am worried, but I think it is good worry and scary.


2020 Fall

Eventually, I took the advice to just take one class in the first semester. I want to lay a solid foundation to my future study in computing systems, hence CS6200 Introduction to Operating System it is.
