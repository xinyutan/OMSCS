The class is different from GIOS in at least that the project doesn't seem to require that much of coding. There is a quiz every week. The things taught in this class are completely new to me. I still need to get used to the way it describes a problem and solution. But I think I start to like this class. The quizes and projects are really helpful in deepening my understanding to the contents. 

The only challenge I face is how to maintain a work-study balance. Yes, because I find myself distracting by some ideas related to work while studying. On one hand, I am glad that my work is so engaging that I like to think about it all the time; but it ain't good for the study... And I know I need to study some new things instead of always doing things I feel comfortable with or that have immediate rewards.

The semester officially started! I got enrolled in this class the last minute (for a moment, I thought I may not be able to take any class). So I am very grateful.

Looking ahead, one thing I am excited about is that I get to use GDB for a project. Last semester, it was recommended to debug using GDB, but I did not do fancy debugging except for printing out stuff (in the case of multi-threading, printing out sometimes isn't ideal because it would block the thread, then I guess I just prayed that my logics worked). It would be nice to be pushed to learn it.
