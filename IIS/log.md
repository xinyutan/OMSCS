Hmm, this class is a little bit more difficult than I thought it would be. The difficulty is in that it sometimes goes really deep into how exactly program excutes. For example, I used to know that when we call a function, something will be pushed to the stack. But what exactly are pushed to stack, what are the registers, I know not clearly.

So I struggled with the project 1 a lot. But I think struggles are good, even though here they are only technical struggles.

falls drop by drop upon the heart
until, in our own despair, against our will,
comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.”

The class is different from GIOS in at least that the project doesn't seem to require that much of coding. There is a quiz every week. The things taught in this class are completely new to me. I still need to get used to the way it describes a problem and solution. But I think I start to like this class. The quizes and projects are really helpful in deepening my understanding to the contents. 

The only challenge I face is how to maintain a work-study balance. Yes, because I find myself distracting by some ideas related to work while studying. On one hand, I am glad that my work is so engaging that I like to think about it all the time; but it ain't good for the study... And I know I need to study some new things instead of always doing things I feel comfortable with or that have immediate rewards.

The semester officially started! I got enrolled in this class the last minute (for a moment, I thought I may not be able to take any class). So I am very grateful.

Looking ahead, one thing I am excited about is that I get to use GDB for a project. Last semester, it was recommended to debug using GDB, but I did not do fancy debugging except for printing out stuff (in the case of multi-threading, printing out sometimes isn't ideal because it would block the thread, then I guess I just prayed that my logics worked). It would be nice to be pushed to learn it.
