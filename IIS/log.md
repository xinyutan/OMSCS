The semester officially started! I got enrolled in this class the last minute (for a moment, I thought I may not be able to take any class). So I am very grateful.

Looking ahead, one thing I am excited about is that I get to use GDB for a project. Last semester, it was recommended to debug using GDB, but I did not do fancy debugging except for printing out stuff (in the case of multi-threading, printing out sometimes isn't ideal because it would block the thread, then I guess I just prayed that my logics worked). It would be nice to be pushed to learn it.
